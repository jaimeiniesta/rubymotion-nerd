# RubyMotion Nerd

I'm following an excellent book about iOS development,
[iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch 3rd ed.](http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/ios_programming_the_big_nerd_ranch_guide_rd_edition_),
and this repo contains the same examples covered, implemented in RubyMotion.

You can [download the original exercises for Xcode / Objective-C](http://www.bignerdranch.com/solutions/iOSProgramming3ed.zip) from the BNR site.
